# Songle
Using the Android Studio development environment I create an app implemented in Java and XML for an Android device. The app implements a location-based mobile phone puzzle game which allows users to follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburghâ€™s Central Area. The words make up the lyrics of a well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words which have been found. Given that it is a song-based puzzle, the game is called Songle.

Words are collected by visiting their location on the map, the
player literally moves to that location with their mobile phone. There are five different
versions of the map for each song, each giving progressively more hints to help the user
guess the song more easily.
