# SELP---Songle
use the Android
Studio development environment to create an app implemented in Java and XML for an
Android device. The app implements a location-based mobile phone puzzle game which
allows users to follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random
around the University of Edinburgh’s Central Area. The words make up the lyrics of a
well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words
which have been found. Given that it is a song-based puzzle, the game is called Songle.
